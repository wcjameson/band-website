    <p>Europe is a Swedish rock band formed in Upplands Väsby, Sweden in 1979,[4] by frontman Joey Tempest, guitarist John Norum, bassist Peter Olsson, and drummer Tony Reno. They obtained a major breakthrough in Sweden in 1982 by winning the televised competition "Rock-SM" (Swedish Rock Championships): it was the first time this competition was held, and Europe became a larger success than the competition itself.

      Since their formation, Europe has released eleven studio albums, three live albums, three compilations and twenty-four music videos. Europe's current lineup comprises Tempest, Norum, bassist John Levén, keyboardist Mic Michaeli, and drummer Ian Haugland.  urope rose to international fame in the 1980s with their third album, 1986's The Final Countdown. Europe has sold 10 million albums worldwide.[5] The band has had two top 20 albums on the Billboard 200 chart (The Final Countdown and Out of This World)[6] and three top 30 singles on the Billboard Hot 100 chart ("The Final Countdown", "Rock the Night" and "Carrie", which reached number 3 on the Billboard Hot 100).[7]</p>
